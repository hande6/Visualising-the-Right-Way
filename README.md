Brexit Opinion Visualization

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that visualizes public opinion data on Brexit over time, comparing two different styles of data presentation. The dataset used (brexit.csv) includes survey results asking if Britain was right or wrong to leave the EU, captured at various points from 2016 onwards.

Project Overview

Original Visualization: Presents the raw time series data of public opinion in a straightforward line chart format.
Improved Visualization: Uses smoothed curves to highlight trends and fluctuations in public opinion more effectively, providing a clearer and more aesthetically pleasing view.
Objectives

The project aims to:

Demonstrate the impact of different visualization techniques on the interpretation of data.
Provide a clear comparison between basic and advanced visualization techniques in conveying public sentiment over time.
Showcase data cleaning and preparation processes necessary for accurate and insightful data visualization.

Tools Used

Python: For data cleaning and manipulation.
Matplotlib: For generating both the original and improved visualizations.
Pandas: For handling the dataset efficiently.
